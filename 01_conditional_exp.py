# Sometimes, decisions are based on conditions.
# In Python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on condition(s). This is what conditionals are for.


# If, elif, and else are conditionals in Python.
# Syntax :
# If (condition1) print("yes"), only if condition1 is true.
# elif(condition2)print("no"), only if condition2 is true.
# else print("maybe"), if otherwise
# code example:
# a = 25
# if(a>30):
#     print("The value of a is greater than 30")
# elif(a>24):
#     print("the value of a is greater than 24")
# else:
#     print("the value of a is not greater than 3 or 7")
